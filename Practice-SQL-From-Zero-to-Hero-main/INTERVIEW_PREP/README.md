    C --> D[Week 5: Data Engineering]
    D --> E[Week 6: Snowflake]
    E --> F[Mock Interviews]
```

1. **Understand, don't memorize** — be able to explain *why*.
2. **Write the queries** — run them against the DataVerse database.
3. **Practice out loud** — interviews test communication too.
4. **Drill the patterns** — window functions and joins appear most.
5. **Do mock interviews** — simulate pressure.

## 💡 Interview-Day Tips

- Clarify requirements before coding (NULLs, ties, duplicates).
- Think aloud — explain your approach.
- Start with a working query, then optimize.
- Know the difference between `RANK`/`DENSE_RANK`/`ROW_NUMBER` cold.
- Be ready to discuss `EXPLAIN` and indexing for optimization questions.
