## 🎣 The Hook

I still remember the first `SELECT` statement I ran that returned real data. It felt like flipping a light switch in a dark room I'd been stumbling through. Suddenly I could *ask the data questions* and get answers. That single keyword started a career.

## 💼 The Business Problem

At DataVerse Inc., a new analyst gets an email from the CEO: *"Can you pull me a list of our employees and what they do?"* No fancy tools. No AI. Just a question that needs an answer from a database with thousands of rows.

## 🧠 The Concept

`SELECT` retrieves data. `FROM` says where. That's the entire foundation:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, job_title
FROM employees;
```

Add a few companions and you can answer most day-one questions:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT job_title          -- unique values
FROM employees
ORDER BY job_title                 -- sorted
LIMIT 10;                          -- just the top 10
```

```sql
-- Combine columns into something readable
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name, job_title
FROM employees
ORDER BY full_name;
```

## 🔬 Why This Matters

Every report, dashboard, and AI feature begins with a `SELECT`. Master these five — `SELECT`, `FROM`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` — and you can already produce value on your first day.
