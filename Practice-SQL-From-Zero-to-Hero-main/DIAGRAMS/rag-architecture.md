# 📊 RAG Architecture

Retrieval-Augmented Generation: ground an LLM in your data so it answers from facts, not hallucinations. The retrieval step is SQL.

## Ingestion (build the knowledge base)

```mermaid
graph LR
    DOCS[Source documents] --> CHUNK[Chunk into passages]
    CHUNK --> EMBED[Embedding model]
    EMBED --> STORE[(pgvector table:<br/>content + metadata + embedding)]
```

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
CREATE TABLE doc_embeddings (
    content TEXT, category VARCHAR(50), embedding vector(1536)
);
CREATE INDEX ON doc_embeddings USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

## Retrieval + Generation (answer a question)

```mermaid
graph LR
    Q[User Question] --> E[Embed question]
    E --> SEARCH[Semantic search:<br/>ORDER BY embedding distance LIMIT k]
    SEARCH --> VDB[(pgvector)]
    VDB --> CHUNKS[Top-k relevant chunks]
    CHUNKS --> PROMPT[Prompt = context + question]
    PROMPT --> LLM[LLM]
    LLM --> ANSWER[Grounded Answer]
```

```sql
-- The heart of RAG is this SELECT
SELECT content
FROM doc_embeddings
ORDER BY embedding <=> :question_embedding  -- cosine distance, nearest first
LIMIT 4;
```

---

## Hybrid Search (the SQL advantage)

```mermaid
graph TB
    Q[Query] --> FILTER[Structured filter<br/>WHERE category = ...]
    Q --> VEC[Vector similarity<br/>ORDER BY embedding distance]
    FILTER --> COMBINE[Combine: precise + semantic]
    VEC --> COMBINE
    COMBINE --> RESULT[Best results]
```

```sql
SELECT content, 1 - (embedding <=> :q) AS similarity
FROM doc_embeddings
WHERE category = 'HR Policy'      -- metadata filter
ORDER BY embedding <=> :q
LIMIT 4;
```

## Why RAG Reduces Hallucination

| Without RAG | With RAG |
|-------------|----------|
| LLM guesses from training data | LLM answers from retrieved facts |
| May invent details | Grounded in your documents |
| No source | Traceable to source chunks |
